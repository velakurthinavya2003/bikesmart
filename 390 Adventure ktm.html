            Can't get better in this price range. Other than the seat rest 
            everything is bang on. Long rides on the default seats can get uncomfortable. 
            Looks, killer.The low end needs some work. Service costs are reasonable. 
            KTM needs to work on the app to make it more appealing and user friendly and usable. 
            Overall the best money can buy with some good features in the price range.

                Value for money.
                Good for long rides.
                Amazing comfort.
                Loaded with Electronics.
                Service costs are reasonable.
                The riding position is very comfortable. Easy to ride in the City.
                Avg 35kmpl highways, 25 kmpl cities.
                Low-end torque will make you use 1st gears for humps.
                Not a complete off-roader, but a great bike for off-road modification as it is lightweight.</pre>
