            Planning to buy this for my daily rides and tour purpose.
            1st point is, mileage
            2nd one is, it's not a high-speed bike. So we easily ride 
              around 100kmph speed. Its safety.
            Using Hornet 160r. But now planning to buy RC 125. Loved
            the 2022 model design. Really eye catchy. Same as rc 200 & 390.
            Needs rear abs too.

                Bad experience, very poor mileage and limited speed and acceleration 
                and very expensive services also, normally I use it for regular use in 
                cities with limited speed also but I am satisfied with this bike, better 
                we should purchase any other bike we were very much option in place of this 
                bike like- gixxer and r15 etc.</pre>
