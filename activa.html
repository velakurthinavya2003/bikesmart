           <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">
            I purchased it in the yr 2021 almost,1yr completed. While riding even 
            for small bumps the vehicle moves cross to the left-hand side. I told this 
            prob at a service station at sowcarpet "balaji service center" and they 
            said alignment prob. They change a few parts in my vehicle saying it crossed
            more than 8000 kms. And at last, I suppose to pay 4000/-. But after a few weeks 
            later again I exp the same prob. Now in the service center they say they need to 
            check the front wheel forks and cone-rod...
            Overall within one yr, with approximately 12000 kms the so-called new activa 
            needs a few parts replacement and with left-hand side moving prob.

                After three or four times using the lock in the seat is not working. 
                Please don't buy activa 6g. Dicky problem worst is constant ringing 
                while driving activa 6g all to have this problem mine is. Please, don't buy . 
                Choose another bike. After three or four times using the lock in the seat is not working.
