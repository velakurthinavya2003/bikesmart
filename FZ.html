            Best in the segment for bachelor riders and what I mostly like about 
            this bike is its refined engine and smooth ride.No 1 bike. The looks of 
            this bike are very attractive and stylish. Especially its chrome design 
            bulky tank looks like a monster. Appreciable and most youths' favorite bike. 
            It is sport looking bike and commuter type.

                This bike is a proper beast with cute and stylish looks. Awesome features with 
                the best rider satisfaction. Surely this can beat other sports bikes. The best 
                part of Yamaha is it always gives proper sounds to its bikes which doesn't harm 
                anybody. At last, Yamaha always do good for customers. So no doubt every bike 
                including Yamaha fz s fi is best.</pre>
