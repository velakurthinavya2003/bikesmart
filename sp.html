                1. Buying Experience is Good Enough as compared to other company showrooms.
                2. Riding is nice as there is no body pain even in the continuous rides.
                3. Look is Bulky, many people like this look and the performance are awesome.
                4. Servicing cost is Reasonable nor too high.
                5. There is only one Cons ie. Sometimes it will create problems in Gear Shifting 
                but you can overcome this problem in Servicing Center..</pre>
