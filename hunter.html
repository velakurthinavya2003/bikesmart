                  If we talk about buying it then the amount is good enough according to its looks,
                  average and silencer sound system. According to my point of view the seat and petrol 
                  tanks look is one of the best looks of the royal Enfield bike collection. I love the
                  gesture mine when I drive my friend's hunter 350.</pre>

                    1. Buying experience was easy, but there was a waiting period of almost
                       30 days for me
                    2. Riding exp: I have ridden this bike for more than 2k kms including long rides, 
                       and city everywhere. Its super fun to ride
                       City use: its too easy to ride in the city, it's very agile and 
                       the wide handlebar helps me to glide in the traffic ( I'm a blore guy) 
                       so this is imp for me also. And I also got  good mileage in the city ~35
