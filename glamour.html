                I bought hero glamour in Oct 2020
                The riding quality is great. You feel too much vibration when the bike goes above 70km/hr.
                The main plus point is its look but most of the parts are not properly fitted.
                Maintenance cost is low but poor service from hero.
                Pro- Great sporty look
                Cons- build quality is poor not for long rides. Power transmission is not that good.
                Go for super splendor rather than this.</pre>
