            <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">
                The bike is super smooth. Coming from a re classic , vstorm for me screams 
                quality and reliability. After having a most un_reliable re bike for 8 years. 
                I felt I should switch to Japanese bike for peace of mind. Loving it now.
                I usually use it for touring and daily office commuting. It's as comfortable as re_classic. 
                Since I'm tall 6.1 I don't have any issue with height.</pre>
