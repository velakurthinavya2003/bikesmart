            Hero super splendor is a wonderful bike in 125cc segment, black color looks meticulous, 
            and mileage and riding are also very good, I strongly recommend this bike for daily commuting.. 
            Service centers and spares availability is not very difficult, the performance and look of the 
            vehicle is good, seat length is comfortable for two people.

                I want to say about the Hero Super Splender motorcycle.
                This bike up to down engine and carburetor are very good and excellent.
                But now it is the worst of the worst.
                I purchased it just two months ago.
                Gear shifting problems very much, the bike goes off during clutch pull in running,
                digital meter functional error, it goes off when two persons boarded on it.
                I have my suggestion please don't buy it.</pre>
