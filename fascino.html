           <h3>  Pulkit Taxali, New Delhi</h3>
           <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">
            First of all, I wish to appreciate yamaha service staff for their courtesy, 
            they helped my dad when he was driving the vehicle for servicing and he found 
            that he ran out of fuel.. Moreover, the vehicle has a road presence which turns 
            off the eyes of onlookers from its rivals.
            besides, the good mileage of 40+ kmpl fascino provides a smooth engine with punching 
            torque which has an efficient pickup to maneuver through city traffic.
            Overall it delivers a great ride and an excellent performance.

                Yamaha gives the best-refined engine always Best mileage in the city and is comfortable. 
                The look is also best than other scooters in the market.After 2 years performance is well 
                cause I do time-to-time service. All things are great but Yamaha should give us a digital 
                speedometer like as Suzuki access.And the petrol tank button give better.</pre>
